        <h2>What is Technical Documentation?</h2>
      </header>
      <p id="def-one">Technical documentation is any piece of writing that describes the application, purpose, creation or architecture of a product or service. Its goal is to explain something that an organization offers. There are several types of technical documents, each intended for a certain audience. Writing technical documents is usually the responsibility of technical writers, project managers, members of a development team or experts on the product or service in question.</p>
      <p>Effectively written documents help the intended audience by educating them on details that are necessary, such as for the operation of a product or the understanding of a topic. Examples of technical documents include:</p>
      <ul>
            <li class="intro-bullets">How-to Guides</li>
             <li class="intro-bullets">User Guides</li>
             <li class="intro-bullets">Presantation</li>
             <li class="intro-bullets">Bronchures</li>
            <li class="intro-bullets">Memo</li>
              <li class="intro-bullets">Press releases</li>
              <li class="intro-bullets">Business plans or proposals</li>
              <li class="intro-bullets">Reviews</li>

          <h2>Types of Documantation</h2>
    
          <p> Examples of technical documents include:</p>
         <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>Process documentation describes the development of a product. The audience for this type of documentation comprises internal members and clients. There's usually some documentation describing every stage of the development life cycle. For example, at the beginning of a project, there are project proposals and then plans that include timelines, milestones and data about the budget. Later, the project manager might submit progress reports or documents detailing step-by-step procedures.</p>
          <h2>User</h2>
          <p>User documents, which are also called product-based documents, relate to products in their finished state. The audience for user documents is usually the end-user. The documents may explain how to install, start-up, troubleshoot or repair a product. Alternatively, they may describe the various features and how to use them or answer frequently asked questions. Companies often package such documents with the product but also provide them online, so they're accessible through the customer support page.</p>
          <p>Other user documents are for a different type of user, particularly for professionals in the same field as those who developed the product. For example, software developers may release technical documentation about the source code of an application. The documents are useful for transferring knowledge to others, who can then work on improving or modifying the product.</p>

          <h2>What Makes for Great Documantation?</h2>
          <p>Technical documentation shouldn’t require a Ph.D. to understand. </p>
          <p>Even if your app is intricate and complex, your documentation should be clear and concise, which is easier said than done. One thing that helps make this happen is being as detailed as possible at every step of the way, even if it feels repetitive. </p>
          <p>You have to give readers an organized way to quickly find information about the features, functions, and resources available to them. This is where a table of contents and active contents outline comes in handy.</p>
          <p>Another important feature of technical documentation is the version, compatibility, language, and revision date associated with the documentation. This information helps give the reader a quick check to make sure they are in the right place to find solutions to their problems. </p>
           <p>Other simple features, like pagination, for example, allow the reader to easily transition between pages within the documentation without having to use the table of contents or search function to continue reading. </p>
           <p>Opportunities to provide feedback and connect with an alternative support channel are also immensely helpful for understanding what documentation is not clear and prioritizing updates to those sections. </p>

          <h2>Better Documantation Tips</h2>
          <p>Writing technical documentation is no easy task.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, the people with the most knowledge on the subject are those who work with it every day: your team. Unfortunately, having the most knowledge on the subject does not always result in the most easy-to-understand documentation.</p>
          <p>Let’s cover a few challenges to watch for and resources to include to level up your documentation. </p>
          <header>Avoid the Curse of Knowledge</header>
          <p>No matter how intuitive you believe your product is or how intuitive it actually is, there will always be someone who doesn’t understand. </p>
          <p>We are hardwired to think about problems from our perspective, which is why our solutions are often riddled with cognitive biases and false assumptions. For example, if you use an iPhone every day, you may forget that Android has a different user experience that must be considered in the docs. </p>
          <p>The curse of knowledge (in regards to documentation) is when you assume the reader has the same level of understanding as you and will be able to decipher acronyms, code samples, and other resources you have provided. </p>
          <p>Even if it seems clear to you without additional context, being repetitive and comprehensive will benefit your documentation and engage more readers.</p>
          <header>Include Screenshots and Screencasts</header>
          <p>According to American educator Edgar Dale, we remember 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30% of what we see, and 50% of what we see and hear.</p>
          <p>If this is true, only 10% of the most well-written documentation will be retained, but including screenshots and screencasts can bring this number into the 30%–50% range.</p>
          <header>Offer Training </header>
          <p>If your app, product, API, or SDK is complex and requires more effort and time for users to grasp the underlying concepts and use it effectively, consider offering in-depth learning resources.</p>
          <p>Google Analytics, for example, has a helpful academy for all levels of knowledge and experience.2 But not everyone has the resources that Google does. And we’re not advocating everyone should have this level of detail.</p>
          <p>Guides, tutorials, articles, and other learning materials can create the basis for your “academy.” Even a sample use case or application can help users learn the intricacies and subtleties of your tool. </p>

          <h2>Examples of Great Documentation</h2>
           <p>As discussed, documentation can range from a one-page requirements sheet to a thick reference manual documenting a new open-source framework. Today, documentation for apps, APIs, SDKs, and even most hardware products are available online. </p>
          <p>Below are a few top-notch examples of various types of technical documentation. </p>
<header>1. End-User Documentation: Apple iPhone</header>
          <p>Apple’s documentation is simple and clear with an option to select the iOS version the user currently has installed, a table of contents for referencing other features, device-specific screenshots, and even the option to connect with the support team directly. </p>
          <header>2. Technical Documentation: Google Apps Script</header>
          <p>The technical documentation of an API allows developers to quickly find their footing with the tool and solve problems that arise during development. 

</p>
          <p>Google provides many helpful features in their technical documentation for their scripting platform, Apps Script, which allows developers to extend their G-Suite platform.</p>
          <header>3. Interactive Documentation: GitHub </header>
          <p>The ability for developers and users to interact with the product, app, API, or otherwise within an easy to use sample environment is a great way to get users onboarded. </p>
          <p>GitHub, for example, provides developers with an easy way to verify their database queries are formatted properly and successfully returning the requested data.4 This split screen view also allows the user to dig into the technical documentation and understand what information the GraphQL API requires as input.</p>
